   - **Issue**: Direct user input usage without sanitization
   - **Risk**: SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive validation middleware with Joi schemas

3. **Weak Error Handling** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Generic errors exposing internal details
   - **Risk**: Information disclosure to attackers
   - **Solution**: Added structured error handling with proper logging

#### 🛡️ Security Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented per-endpoint rate limiting
- **Input Sanitization**: Added middleware to prevent XSS/injection attacks
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js with CSP configuration
- **CORS Protection**: Proper origin validation
- **JWT Security**: Enhanced token validation and refresh logic

#### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
1. **Error Handling Middleware** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Centralized error processing
   - Structured logging with Winston
   - Environment-aware error responses
   - Custom error classes for different scenarios

2. **Service Layer Refactoring** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Fixed resource cleanup in DataCollectionService
   - Added proper transaction handling
   - Implemented exponential backoff for failures
   - Added connection pooling and retry logic

3. **Middleware Enhancement** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Authentication middleware with proper error handling
   - Authorization middleware with role-based access
   - Input validation middleware with detailed error messages
   - Security middleware bundle

#### 📝 Code Quality Improvements
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Fixed type safety issues
